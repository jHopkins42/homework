General homework file_repo


This is a location to store the general and various homework projects, public-facing works-in-process files, and general 
files where they might be considered open-source or public license.  The majority of these files will be tester versions of 
code that might land elsewhere, either something I'm trying to figure out or something I'm trying to reverse engineer.

At no point should these files be considered restricted or private.

While I am currently (as of 27 November, 2022) erolled in a coding class, this repo will continue to be used after class
for the purposes of storing starter code, seed code files, and test functions that I'm tyring to work out concepts or 
debug issues I come across.  I'm leaving it public so that others might learn from my mistakes, and possibly others
could find this and comment with corrections.

(If others do wish to help correct the files, I ask that you comment on what the correct code would be without removing
any nonfunctioning code.  Include your name/handle and the date in your comment.  I'd like the logs to record the corrections
in comment form so that someone might search and discover they have the same issue - and what effects it has when code is
previewed - without having the learning process of the corrections being done for them.)
